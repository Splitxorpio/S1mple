        <h3>Introduction to Python</h3>
        <hr>
        <P>Python is one of the most popular and most beginner friendly languages out there. You can learn alot of simple functions in an hour thanks to it's beginner friendly Libraries.
          To start our course lets just type some simple code, so create a file in your IDE and name it "helloworld.py" and type the following code below:
        </P>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>and then run your code, you should get an output that says:</p>
        <img class="py_world_pic"src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851987565066453005/853359370158080040/unknown.png" alt="">      
        <br><br>
        <p>The next thing you are going to learn are variables and Strings. Think of variables as a bucket, and strings are the things inside of the bucket.  </p>
        <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851987565066453005/853362963242418186/unknown.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The variable is name and the string stored in name is "stacy"</p> 
        <p>So if we do print(name), instead of name it will output what is in name. AKA Stacy.</p>

        <h3>Significance of Python</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>If you are a beginner, Python is a great language to start off with. It has libraries that are so simple its unreal, it is perfect when it comes to problem solving and many other things.
          Python has pros and cons, but when it comes to beginner coding, Python is a great language to start with.

        <h3>Operators</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Like Python, Operators are to add/subtract/multiply/divide two <strong>integers </strong>or <strong>floats</strong>.
          the '+' operator is for adding, the '-' operator is for subtracting, the '*' operator is for multiplying, and the '/' operator is for dividing.
        </p> 
        <img class="python_op_pic" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851987565066453005/853372101351833630/unknown.png">

      <div class="course-container">
        <h3>Loops</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>A for loop is a python statement that loops what ever is inside of it a certain amount of times. This is extremely useful if you find yourself repeating code.</p>
        <img class="python_loop_pic" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851987565066453005/853375635213123604/unknown.png">
        <p>In this case, it will print brandon 7 times, since there are seven characters in 'brandon'</p>
        <p>The range function helps python understand how many times to print something, so if you do "for i in range(name)" it will tell python to check how many characters are in the name variable,
          same goes for numbers, if you do "for i in range(10)", python will know to repeat whatver is in the for loop 10 times.
        </p>

        <h3>If Statements</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>If statements are to compare things, if one thing is equal to another, then ouput something.</p>

        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>Functions is when Python gets fun, Functions are the main part of everything and is what makes a language do stuff. You must define the function, and then call it. A function can be called anytime after it has been defined.
          Functions allow developers to do certain tasks, so lets get started.
          to define it you do:
        </p>
        <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851987565066453005/853390245789171752/unknown.png">
        <p>
          After defining, you put what you want the function to do, so lets make it print hello world like before
        </p>
        <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851987565066453005/853390339547988008/unknown.png">
        <p>
          After that, we call it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now run the code and you should get:
        </p>
